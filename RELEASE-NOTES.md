### Version 2.1.6 - Nov 6, 2015

- **Checkbox/Dropdown/Search** - Fixed issue where dropdown/checkbox `change` events were not bubbling. (Dispatched events were swapped to use native `document.creatEvent` in `2.1.5` unfortunately the flag to bubble events was mistakenly off.)

#### Features

- **Flag** - England flag alias is now correctly set [#2770 **Thanks @eduardom**](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/om**)

### UI Changes

- **Flag** - Reduced the file size of flag sprite to a measly 28kb (500%+ file size reduction)
- **Flag** - Updated Burma/Myanmar flag to current flag (was pre-2010 flag)
